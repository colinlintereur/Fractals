# Fractals

TESTEDIT: Colin Lintereur

## Description
This repo was an experiment for me to test out JS and HTML/CSS integration to make a program that implements the Chaos Game. In this game, you make a triangle out of three points and then pick a point within the triangle. Then, you pick a random corner of the triangle and make new point halfway between that corner and the original point within the triangle. You repeat this process with a new random corner and the last point you just created until a fractal emerges. This program allows you to pick the coordinates of the positions of the corners of the triangle and the first point within the traingle. You also pick how many points you want to make within the triangle for the fractal to appear better. This was mainly a learning experience for me so it is not very polished or anything but I thought it was interesting so here it is!
